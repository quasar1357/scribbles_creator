(V01 - images 0-4)

pred01 - images 0-10 (scribbles local)
	convpaint (default multichannel)
	Ch1 - only one channel because ilastik not ready for multichannel yet
	multichannel

scribbles_run01 - ~100 images at a time (not complete), some scribbles not ideal in edge cases

scribbles_run02 - optimized for edge cases (min 1 pixels etc.; not sped up lines yet)
	pred02 - some weird predicitons for convpaint ???
		test450 - test on image with weird prediciton for convpaint...
	pred03 - predict again with fixed seed (= 123) --> similar weird predicitons
!	pred04 - predict again with same seed (= 123) and channel extraction and normalization
	pred05 - test convpaint scalings and layers: predict every 10th image, but with 3 layer and 4 scaling combinations (= total 12x)
		run01: was interrupted by errors, but still some results
!		run02: only done with l-0 and l-0-2 but all scalings (0.1% scribbles)
		test: just to make sure the results can be reproduced with img 500, and testing different seeds... (x: seed=123, y: seed=5)
!		run03: same as run02 but with 1% scribbles
scribbles_run03 (former cluster_run03) - create scribbles with approx. 10% using 1.25 bin and scribble_width=6 for images {0..539..10}
	NOTE: scribbles with suffix _x_ were dilated (scribble_width=6)
!	pred06: prediction on ~10% scribbles using diff. Convpaint settings...
!	pred07: prediction on ~10% scribbles using Ilastik
(!)	pred07b: same as 07, on the remaining pictures after fixing selection of ilastik_function (single vs. multi_channel)

!	pred08: prediciton on the 3 bins with DINO --> accidentally took 0.01% bin instead of 1%
(!)	pred08b: do same with 1% bin




scribbles_run04 - all 540 images, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1 with w1 and 10% with w6
	With adjusted script, e.g. sample until mergin reached etc.
	BUT: The removing of pixels if the % exceeds the max (after dilation) was not implemented properly; but shouldn't be an issue...
	NOTE: In some cases there were more pixels sampled than intended! (e.g. cellpose img 222, bin 0.025)
	--> accidentally deleted all scribbles! ...
	2 analyses: second one with new metrics...

run05	After fixing the above issues, dilation inside loop, and edge cases handled properly

run06	Use scribbles of run05 (copied over, named run06 but in fact from run05), but convpaint prediction with all features (not splitting off eval/test...)
	run06a --> initial run06 with buggy ilastik (prob>0.5 instead of max. prob)
	run06  --> everything from run06a but with fixed ilastik
