run01   just testing the pipeline on some images... (locally)
run02   create scribbles and run predictions on 23 images (locally) to get a good idea of the models' performances
run03	run on 460 images
	scribbles sind identisch mit lokalem run, aber preds nicht (obwohl gl. seed) --> ok?
	1792 hatte memory problem (scribble_creator)... --> skippen; dafür bis 4904 --> trotzdem gerade 460 imgs
	run03b	just some local tests to verify run03

run04	New run together with cellpose
	With adjusted script, e.g. sample until mergin reached etc.
	BUT: The removing of pixels if the % exceeds the max (after dilation) was not implemented properly; but shouldn't be an issue...
	NOTE: In some cases there were more pixels sampled than intended! (e.g. cellpose img 222, bin 0.025)
	2 analyses: second one with new metrics...

run05	After fixing the above issues, dilation inside loop, and edge cases handled properly

run06	Use scribbles of run05 (copied over, named run06 but in fact from run05), but convpaint prediction with all features (not splitting of eval/test...)
	run06a --> initial run06 with buggy ilastik (prob>0.5 instead of max. prob)
	run06  --> everything from run06a but with fixed ilastik
